# Install (Windows)

Download the zip and extract `json.summer.udl.xml` file into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs\` (or where your user defined languages are stored).

Restart Notepad++ if it's open.

> If the colors don't show up, make sure that the language is set to `JSONPropValues`

# Customize

To change colors, under **Language** in the menu bar navigate to **User Defined Language** -> **Define your language**. Colors can be changed by opening the **Styler** dialog for the setting in question.
